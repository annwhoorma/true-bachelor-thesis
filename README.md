## Description

This project is my bachelor's thesis. It is about training a graph neural network to distinguish between neutral graph and segregated/integrated graph.

The repository contains code for producing graphs and calculating metrics for them.

To run datasets generation, run _dataset.py_. In this file's code you can change the desired number of graphs for train, valid and test datasets.

Parameters specified in _globalenv.py_ can be modified.
